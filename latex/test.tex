\item Scatter output statements throughout the code. The more the better.
\item Debug the program into existence. Keep on adding and removing statements until something works.
\item Never back up earlier versions. Who can't remember what he or she did just 5 min ago?
\item Don't bother understanding what the program should do. If it's not obvious, make it obvious.
\item Don't waste time understanding the problem. Most problems are trivial, anyway.
\item Use the most obvious fix. Fix the symptom not the problem.

\item \textbf{crc32} - Designed for checksums. It's fast, but its security properties are not very good - it's very easy to find a \emph{collision}, when two things hash to the same value.
\item \textbf{md5} - Used to be used because it was pretty fast and pretty secured. But it's not secure any longer - it's easy to find collisions. It's found on every system.
\item \textbf{sha1} - Not as fast, but fairly secured. Second most widely used hash after md5.
\item \textbf{sha256} - If you are really worried about securing your data, but it's the slowest.
\item \textbf{bcrypt} - Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive hash: over time it can be made slower and slower so it remains resistant to specific brute-force search attacks against the hash and the salt.
\end{list}

\subsection{range vs xrange}\index{python!range}\index{python!xrange}

range creates a list in memory, but xrange is a generator, so it evaluates lazily.



\subsection{Variables}\index{python!Variables}

\subsubsection{Global}\index{python!Variables!Global}

Local variables overrides a global of the same name. To prevent that behaviour and
to be able to modify the variable within a function, python must be told to use the
name in a global sense.

Invented in the 1970s.

\input{sqlite}

\subsubsection{index}\index{SQL!index}

A \emph{sequential scan}\index{SQL!index!sequential scan} doesn't work fine when you have a million rows to scan. Indexes increase the speed of database reads, but probably decrease the speed of database inserts, since the indexes have to be updated.

\begin{tabular}{l}
explain analyze select name from users where id = 123; \\
create index user\_id on users(id); \\
drop index user\_id;
\end{tabular}

\textbf{hashtable}, not sorted, lookup in constant time

\textbf{tree}, sorted, lookup in the log n order



\subsection{ACID}\index{ACID}

\textbf{Atomicity.} All parts of a \emph{transaction} succeed or fail together.

\textbf{Consistency.} The database will always be consistent. The database will move from one valid transaction to the next. \emph{Replication lag}\index{ACID!replication lag} is an example of the loss of consistency.

\textbf{Isolation.} No transaction can interfere with another's. Sometimes accomplished by \emph{locking}\index{ACID!locking}.

\textbf{Durability.} Once the transaction is comitted, it won't be lost.

\subsection{Decorator Notation}\index{Decorator Notation}

\subsubsection{Function Mapping - An expressiveness tool}

Extend a binary function to a function that can take any number of arguments.

\input{n_ary}

This pattern is so common in python, that there's a special notation for it, called the Decorator Notation.

\input{seq_decorated}

But there is one problem with how we have specfied this decorator. In an interactive session, asking for help on seq, it is called \emph{n\_ary\_f}. To fix this:

\input{n_ary_wrapped}

We have, though, introduced some repetition now. We always want to update the wrapper for every decorator.

\input{n_ary_decorated}

or

\subsection{Regular Expressions}\index{Regular Expressions}

Regular expressions describe regular languages and can be represented by a FSM.
If a language is regular, then that language is also context free.
The module to import in python is called re. A regular expression is written

\subsubsection{findall}\index{Regular Expressions!findall}
\input{findall}

where the \emph{r} actually means \emph{raw string} instead of \emph{regular expression}. The + and * operators are called \emph{Kleene Operators}\index{Regular Expressions!Kleene Operators} after Stephen C. Kleene.

\subsubsection{search}\index{Regular Expressions!search}
\input{search}j

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
	\textbackslash b & word boundary \\
	* & Kleene Operator \\
	+ & Kleene Operator
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{split}\index{Regular Expressions!split}
\input{re_split}

\subsubsection{sub}\index{Regular Expressions!sub}
\input{re_sub}


\subsection*{•}

Grammar describe context free languages, a more powerful set of strings than regular languages, and is represented by context free grammar. If a language is context-free, then that language is sometimes also regular.

\begin{tabular}{r l}
	r'ab' $\Rightarrow$ & g $\rightarrow$ a b \\
	r'a*' $\Rightarrow$ & g $\rightarrow \epsilon$ \\
	& g $\rightarrow$ a g \\
	r'a$|$b' $\Rightarrow$ & g $\rightarrow$ a \\
	& g $\rightarrow$ b \\	
\end{tabular}

It's f.ex. impossible to capture balanced parenthesis with regular expressions.

A grammar is abiguous if at least 1 string in the grammar has more than 1 different parse tree.

\subsection{call-by-name}

Scala normally uses call-by-value. For expressions in practice, call-by-value is often exponentially more efficient than call-by-name, because it avoids repeated recomputation of argument expressions that call-by-name entails. It also plays much nicer with imperative effects and side effects, since you tend to know much better when expressions will be evaluated.

Terminates more often.

Sometimes you want to force call-by-name and Scala lets you do that by preceeding the function parameter by =>.


\subsection{Lists}

Scala collections systematically distinguish between mutable and immutable collections. A mutable collection can be updated or extended in place. This means you can change, add, or remove elements of a collection as a side effect. Immutable collections, by contrast, never change. You have still operations that simulate additions, removals, or updates, but those operations will in each case return a new collection and leave the old collection unchanged. By default, Scala always picks immutable collections.

\subsubsection{init}

\input{scala_list_init}



\subsection{variables}

\subsubsection{immutable}\index{Scala!variables!immutable}

An immutable "variable" is read-only and is declared with the keyword \textsf{val} and then also, must be defined.

\begin{verbatim}
scala> val array: Array[String] = new Array(5)
array: Array[String] = Array(null, null, null, null, null)

scala> array = new Array(2)
<console>:8: error: reassignment to val
       array = new Array(2)
       
scala> array(0) = "Hello"

scala> array
res1: Array[String] = Array(Hello, null, null, null, null)
\end{verbatim}

The \textsf{array} reference cannot be changed to point to a different \textsf{Array}, but the array itself
can be modified.


\subsection{mutable}\index{Scala!variables!mutable}

A mutable variable is declared with the keyword \textsf{var} and also requires a definition.

\begin{verbatim}
scala> var string: String = "example"
string: String = example

scala> string = "next example"
string: String = next example
\end{verbatim}

However, the \textsf{string} reference can be changed to point to a different \textsf{String} object as often as you want.



\subsection{functions}\index{Scala!function}

\subsubsection{overloading}\index{Scala!function!overloading}

\input{scala_func_overloading}


\subsubsection{default value}\index{Scala!functions!default value}

You don't need to overload functions, when dealing with default values.

\input{scala_func_default_value}


\subsubsection{higher order functions}\index{Scala!functions!higher order functions}

Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called \textit{higher order functions}.

\input{scala_higher_order_func}


\subsubsection{anonymous functions}\index{Scala!functions!anonymous functions}

An anonymous function doesn't have a name.

\textit{Tail-recursive}

\input{scala_anonymous_func}



\subsubsection{currying}\index{Scala!functions!currying}

\textit{Currying} is named after its instigator, Haskell Brooks Curry (1900-1982), a logician. It is also no coincidence that Haskell Brooks Curry shares his first name with the programming language Haskell. However, the idea goes back even further to Schoenfinkel and Frege, but the term "currying" has stuck. 

By defining a function that returns a function, you can separate the implicit function from the arguments, which can arrive in a different parameter list applied later on in a different context.

\subsection{Fixed Point}\index{Algorithms!Fixed Point}

Square root of x is a fixed point of the function that map y to x over y. If square root doesn't converge, we can make it converge by averaging successive values. This technique of stabilizing by averaging is general enough to merit being abstracted into its own function. 

\textbf{In Scala}

\subsection{Big Theta}\index{Algorithms!Big Theta}

$\Theta(g(n))$: The set of functions that grow "equally" quickly as $g(n)$.\\
$f(n)\in\Theta(g(n))$ iff $\exists c_1, c_2, n_0$ such that $0\le c_1*g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2*g(n), \forall n>n_0$\\
$\Rightarrow g(n)\in\Theta(f(n))$


\subsection{factorial}\index{Algorithms!factorial}

\textbf{In Scala.} \textit{Tail-recursive}

\textit{Tail recursive} functions are iterative processes. A \textit{tail-recursive} function call itself as its last action, which means that the function's stack frame can be reused.

\section{Game Theory}

\subsection{Utility Fuction}

The end state has a value of 1 if it is a winning state, 0 if it is a loosing state. The previoius state for me chooses to maximize the value, while the opponent's chooses to minimize the value. The utility for a dice is the average value.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Here's a mathematical proof, accepted by experts that shows the cipher is secure (only the One Time Pad)

The cipher must not depend on secrecy of the mechanism. It must not matter if it falls into the hands of the enemy. - \textit{Kerckhoff's Principle (1883)}

The first and only perfect cipher, but very impractical, because it requires a key with the same size as the message.

\subsection{Shannon's Keyspace Theorem}
\label{sec:shannon's_keyspace_theorem}

\subsection{Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher}\index{Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciper}

Each letter in the alphabet is mapped to a substitution letter.

\textbf{CT only attack}. "E" is the most common letter in the English language (appears about 12.7\% of the time), which will appear as the most frequent coded letter in the cipher. Next is "T" (9.1\%), "A" (8.1\%), etc. Next step is to study frequency of pairs of letters: "he", "an", "in", etc.

One way to prove that the cipher is imperfect, is to use \emph{Shannon's Keyspace Theorem}\ref{sec:shannon's_keyspace_theorem}. Assume a 26-letter alphabet,

\begin{equation}
|K| < |M|, 26! < 2^{89}, 26! < 26^{19}.
\end{equation}

Another way to prove the cipher's imperfection is by showing a ciphertext \emph{c} that could not decrypt to a message \emph{m} for any key \emph{k},

c = \mathsf{aa}, m = \mathsf{cs}

$K(s) = $length of the shortest possible description of s [Andrey Kolmogorov (1903-1987)]. If there isn't any short program that can describe the sequence, that's an indication that the sequence is random, e.i, \emph{s} is random if $K(s) = |s| + C$. There's no simplier way to understand the sequence other than to see the whole sequence. However, the Kolmogorov Complexity is \textbf{uncomputable}.

\textbf{Statistical Tests} - can only show non-randomness. We can always find some non-random sequence that satisfies all of our statistical tests.

\textbf{Physically Random Events}\begin{list}{*}{

\setlength{\labelwidth}{1.5em}
\setlength{\labelsep}{0.5em}
}
\item Quantum Mechanics
\item Thermal Noise
\item User key presses/mouse movements (?)
\end{list}

\textbf{Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)}\index{Pseudo-Random Number Generator} takes a small amount of physical randomness and turn them into a long sequence of apparently "random" bits. This can be done by extracting a seed once from a \emph{random pool} and reusing it in every step, encrypting a sequence of values (which can be a counter).

Does this produce a sequence that appears random? No, it repeats values too infrequently, why the key is changed every few million outputs. Another concern is whether the pool of randomness is good enough. On unix machines, this pool is stored in \emph{/dev/random} and is collecting events that are believed to be random, like user interactions. A popular PRNG is \emph{Fortuna}.

\subsection{Secret Sharing}

Share a 100-bit long secret among 4 people requires 300 key bits.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
A: m \oplus k_1 \oplus k_2 \oplus k_3 \\
B: k_1 \\
C: k_2 \\
D: k_3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 
\subsection{Cipher Block Chaning (CBC) Mode}\index{CBC Mode}

Assuming \emph{E} has perfect secrecy (impossible since $|K| \ge |M|$), an attacker can still learn the length of the message and which blocks in \emph{m} are equal from a captured \emph{c}, where

\begin{equation}
c_i = E_k(m_i)
\end{equation}

With CBC, 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_0 = E_k(m_0 \oplus IV) \\
c_i = E_k(m_i \oplus c_{i-1})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where the initial message block is xor:ed with an initialization vector, \emph{IV}, which should not be repeated. The point with the initialization vector is just to hide repetition in the first block. Being lost, the whole message can still be recovered, except for the very first block.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
m_0 = D_k(c_0) \oplus IV \\
m_{n-i} = D_k(c_{n-1}) \oplus c_{n-2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{list}{*}{
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{2em}
\setlength{\labelwidth}{1.5em}
\setlength{\labelsep}{0.5em}
}
\item Requires the encryption function to be invertable
\item Does not need the IV to be kept secret, used like another cipher text block. Important is just to not reuse the IV
\item Does not provide any protection against tampering
\item The final cipher text block depends on all message blocks
\end{list}

\subsection{Lexical Analysis - Lexing}

Break something down into words. A \emph{token} is the smallest unit of lexical analysis output.

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
	LANGLE & $<$ \\
	LANGLESLASH & $<$\slash \\
	RANLGE & $>$ \\
	EQUAL & = \\
	STRING & "google.com" \\
	WORD & Welcome!
\end{tabular}

A \emph{Lexical Analyzer} or \emph{lexer} is a collection of token definitions, with the first listed is the winner.

\input{tokens}

A state can be either \emph{exclusive} or \emph{inclusive}.

\input{token_states}

\subsection{Syntactical Analysis - Parsing}

Breaking down a list of tokens to see if it's valid in the grammar or breaking down a list of words to see if they follow the rules of a language.

A \emph{parsing state} is a rewrite rule from the grammar, augmented with one red dot on the right hand side of the rule.

\input{parsing}

\subsection{JavaScript}\index{JavaScript}

\emph{Identifier} are \emph{variable} names or \emph{function} names.

\input{factorial}
\input{token_eolcomment}
\input{token_identifier}

\subsection*{Counter (CTR) Mode}\index{CTR Mode}

The IV is usually devided into a \emph{nonce} and the counter in 64-blocks each (for AES).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
c_i = E_k(\textsf{nonce}||i) \oplus m_i \\
m_i = c_i \oplus E_k(\textsf{nonce}||i)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{2em}
\setlength{\labelwidth}{1.5em}
\setlength{\labelsep}{0.5em}
}
\item The encryption function does not need to be invertable
\item The cipher text is a little longer than the message
\item If you encrypt the samme message twice, you will get different ciphertexts
\item Parallelizable (unlike CBC). The encryption function does not depend on the message and can be computed in advance. if you have 3 AES engines encryption will work 3 times as fast
\item Does not need padding
\item In every single aspect CTR Mode dominates CBC and is the recommended mode to be used today
\end{list}

\subsection*{Cipher Feedback (CFB) Mode}

Uses an additional parameter $s < n$, which is the size of the message block that is less than the normal block size of the cipher.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x_0 = IV \\
x_i = x_{i-1}[s:]||c_{i-1} \\
c_i = E_k(x_i)[:s] \oplus m_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Decryption

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
m_i = c_i \oplus E_k(x_i)[:s] \\
x_i = x_{i-1}[s:]||c_i \\
x_0 = IV
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\item Does not require the encryption function to be invertable
\item Does not need the IV to be kept secret, used like another cipher text block. Important is just to not reuse the IV.
\item Can use small message blocks, by only encrypt the message in chunks of size s. Turns the block cipher into a stream cipher
\item Does not provide any protection against tampering
\item The final cipher text block depends on all message blocks
